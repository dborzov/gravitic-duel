## Graphic Asset List & Generation Prompts

These are suggestions based on the spec. Sizes are relative examples for a 2560x1440 screen; adjust as needed during development. Prompts are conceptual for AI image generation or guidance for an artist.

**Style:** "Vivid pixel art, bright saturated colors, clean outlines, space theme, reminiscent of Starbound but for a top-down 2D view."

1.  **Rocket Sprite:**
    * `filename`: `rocket.png`
    * `size`: ~48x48 pixels
    * `prompt`: "Pixel art sprite of a small, sleek spaceship/rocket, top-down view, single primary color (e.g., bright blue for P1 base, bright red for P2 base), simple design, facing upwards. Include transparent background." (Generate variants or color-shift in code for P1/P2).
2.  **Missile Sprite:**
    * `filename`: `missile.png`
    * `size`: ~16x16 pixels
    * `prompt`: "Pixel art sprite of a small, simple energy projectile or tiny missile, top-down view, bright glowing color (e.g., yellow or green), facing upwards. Transparent background."
7.  **Moon Sprite:**
    * `filename`: `explosion.png`
    * `size`: ~30x30 pixels
    * `prompt`: "Pixel art sprite of a small, simple moon, top-down circular view, grey rocky texture or plain color. Transparent background." (Can be reused for all moons, or create 2-3 minor variants).
